# Pomodoro Timer

A simple, visually engaging Pomodoro Timer app built with Python and Tkinter.
I wanted to build an easy to use , intuitive pomodoro timer app. As someone with attention deficit, I often struggle with using pomodoro timers available online which have way too many features and stimuli making them distracting and counter-efficient. 

## Features


- Visual shrinking arc timer
- Customizable number of Pomodoros per session
- Progress bar and checkmarks for completed Pomodoros
- Start, Stop, and Reset controls


## Usage

1. Enter the number of Pomodoros you want to do this session.
2. Click **Start** to begin the timer.
3. Use **Stop** to pause and **Reset** to start a new session.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
